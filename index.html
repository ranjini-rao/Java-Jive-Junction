  <h2>Discover the World of Coffee with Us</h2>
  <p>Coffee has plenty of nicknames, but ‘Java’ is one of the most common ones. How did this come to be? Well the term "Java" has become synonymous with coffee due to the historical importance of the island of Java in the early global coffee trade.
    While it may have originated as a geographic reference, the term has taken on a broader colloquial meaning, representing a connection to the heritage and quality associated with coffee cultivation on the island.
